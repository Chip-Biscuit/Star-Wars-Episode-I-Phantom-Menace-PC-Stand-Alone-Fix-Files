# Phantom Menace PC – Core Patch
## Modern Engine Fixes, FOV System & 60 FPS Mod

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This project provides a core engine patch for
Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (PC).

Focus:
- Reverse-engineered engine fixes
- Runtime patching
- Gameplay improvements
- Modern compatibility
- Preservation of the original PC version

This release contains ONLY Chip’s patches.

Third-party tools are required and must be installed separately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# LEGAL NOTICE

You must legally own an original retail copy of the game.

This patch:
- does NOT include game data
- does NOT distribute copyrighted assets
- modifies the game at runtime only

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 64 bit installer

if you are unable to install the game then it is HIGHLY recomended you use my custom 64 bit installer port everything is automated
and it is by far the easiest method to install the game with all of the modern enhancements to get it running perfectly with the least effort required
as it does do things like setting DPI aware, changing some in game settings for controller and EAX depending on if you installed it and a few other automated things to make life easy

# WHAT THIS PATCH DOES

Core engine improvements:

- 60 FPS modification (original game is 30 FPS)
- Runtime FOV toggle system
- Engine timing fixes
- Stability adjustments
- Modern Windows compatibility improvements

IMPORTANT:

DXWrapper is strongly recommended for stable frame pacing and smooth
performance when using the 60 FPS patch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# REQUIRED INSTALLATION ORDER

Install components in this order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1) ThirteenAG — Ultimate ASI Loader (REQUIRED)

Required to load the core patch.

https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader

Steps:


1. Go to the website above navigate to the releases page download (Ultimate-ASI-Loader.zip)
2. Extract archive
3. Locate:
   dinput8.dll
4. Rename:
   dinput8.dll → DINPUT.dll
5. Copy DINPUT.dll into the game directory (next to WMAIN.exe)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2) Chip Core Patch

1. Extract this release
2. Copy the "scripts" folder into the game directory
3. Launch using WMAIN.exe

The patch loads automatically at runtime.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3) elishacloud — DXWrapper (REQUIRED FOR STABLE 60 FPS and error "could not initialize graphics hardware" on AMD graphics)

DXWrapper provides:

- Stable frame pacing for the 60 FPS patch
- Anti-aliasing
- Anisotropic filtering
- Borderless fullscreen mode
- Modern GPU compatibility (AMD / NVIDIA / Intel)
- And much more

Download:
https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper

INSTALLATION

1. Go to the releases page
2. Download the archive (dx7.games.zip)
3. Extract the archive
4. Copy the following files into the game directory
   (next to WMAIN.exe):

   ddraw.dll
   dxwrapper.dll
   dxwrapper.ini

5. Open dxwrapper.ini in a text editor.
6. Locate the [d3d9] section.
7. Ensure it is configured exactly as follows:
```
[d3d9]
AnisotropicFiltering       = 1
AntiAliasing               = 1
EnableMultisamplingATOC    = 0
EnvironmentCubeMapFix      = 0
DepthBiasFactor            = 0
DepthBiasDropOffValue      = 0
EnableVSync                = 0
ForceVsyncMode             = 0
ShowFPSCounter             = 0
OverrideRefreshRate        = 0
LimitDisplayModeCount      = 0
CustomDisplayWidth         = 0
CustomDisplayHeight        = 0
LimitPerFrameFPS           = 0
EnableWindowMode           = 0
WindowModeBorder           = 0
WindowModeGammaShader      = 0
SetInitialWindowPosition   = 0
InitialWindowPositionLeft  = 0
InitialWindowPositionTop   = 0
FullscreenWindowMode       = 1
ForceExclusiveFullscreen   = 0
ForceMixedVertexProcessing = 0
ForceSystemMemVertexCache  = 0
UseShadowBackbuffer        = 0
OverrideStencilFormat      = 0
FlipEx                     = 0
SetSwapEffectShim          = 0
DisableMaxWindowedMode     = 0
GraphicsHybridAdapter      = 0
```
6. Save the file.
7. Launch the game.

IMPORTANT NOTES

- FullscreenWindowMode = 1 enables borderless fullscreen.
- AntiAliasing and AnisotropicFiltering improve visual quality.
- VSync is disabled to prevent timing conflicts with the 60 FPS patch.

DXWrapper is considered part of the modern configuration
for stable performance.

dgVoodoo could be used in place of elisha wrapper however it is up to the user from my tests elisha wrapper worked
much better. the two cannot be used in tandem and you must pick one or the other this is user preference but i will recomend the one that worked best in my personal testing.

# 6) samuelgr — Xidi (RECOMMENDED)

Provides modern XInput controller support and remapping.

Download:
https://github.com/samuelgr/Xidi

The game is 32-bit. Do NOT use the x64 version.

# STANDARD INSTALL

1. Extract the Xidi archive.
2. Open the "Win32" folder.
3. Copy:

   winmm.dll

   into the game directory (next to WMAIN.exe).

4. Create a new text file in the game directory.

   Xidi.ini

   (Ensure it is not saved as Xidi.ini.txt)

6. Open Xidi.ini and paste the following:
```
[Mapper]
Type                = PhantomMenace

[CustomMapper:PhantomMenace]
StickLeftX          = Axis(X)
StickLeftY          = Axis(Y)
StickRightX         = Split( Compound( Keyboard(LAlt), Keyboard(RIGHT) ), Compound( Keyboard(LAlt), Keyboard(LEFT) ) )
StickRightY         = null
ButtonA             = Button(1)
ButtonB             = Button(2)
ButtonX             = Button(3)
ButtonY             = Button(4)

DpadRight           = Pov(Right)
```
7. Save the file.
8. Launch the game.

# Controller Notes:

- Start opens the in-game menu.
- roll on right analogue stick as in the ps1 version
- Back toggles FOV (mapped to F1).
- If you change the FOV hotkey inside scripts/chip.ini,
  you must update ButtonBack inside Xidi.ini to match.


# FALLBACK METHOD (Some Systems)

If controller fails to initialise:

1. Rename:
   winmm.dll → winm2.dll

2. Open WMAIN.exe in a hex editor.

3. Search:
   winmm.dll

4. Replace with:
   winm2.dll

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT change string length.
It must remain 8 characters.

5. Save file.
6. Ensure winm2.dll and Xidi.ini are in the game directory.
7. Launch game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 7) Launching the Game

Play the game using the WMAIN.exe or make a shorcut to WMAIN.exe on your desktop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FOV SYSTEM

Default hotkey: F1

To apply FOV changes:

1. Press FOV hotkey
2. Press ESC
3. Close menu

FOV updates after camera refresh.

Before level transitions:
